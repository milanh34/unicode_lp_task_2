=> Key features to be implemented :
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Use Material ui/ Tailwind css.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Learn and implement React hooks (study what they are and their uses) 
=> Problem Statement :
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Have different fields that take input such as (text field, dropdown, radio buttons) name, email, password, confirm password, phone number, gender (radio button) and birthdate (drop down).
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Validate the fields using regex.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Make all fields compulsory fields i.e. unless all the fields are filled the form should not be submitted.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. When entering a password, make sure that the password matches the confirm password field.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The input fields should be in autofocus when the page loads.
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. You may also use in-built toasts available in material ui/tailwind to show the successful login/signup message.
  
=> Bonus Task -  
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. On successful signup display the details of the user
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If you successfully implement regex, try using Formik yup for validation
